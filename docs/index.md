This is my personal Home Assistant configuration, awakening my home with automations. I hope this will help you inspire to start your home automation journey.

!!!attention "⚠️ Beware of changes"
    I constantly improve my home. It evolves as I add new devices and services. It's changing as my daily routines are changing.

    Please, keep in mind **this documentation might be outdated** in covering some details. However, I'll try my best to keep this updated.

The best way to discover new ideas and inspire is by [reading the code][github-url], copying-pasting parts of my configuration and adjusting it to your needs.

Read this documentation to see the bigger picture:

## 📦 What's inside?

My home setup for those who are too lazy to read everything:

- [Home Assistant](https://home-assistant.io) OS running on [Raspberry Pi 5 8GB](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-5/).
- Various addons, such as [OpenThead Border Router](https://openthread.io/guides/border-router/), [Matter Server](https://csa-iot.org/all-solutions/matter/) and [xknx](https://xknx.io/home_assistant) for devices.
- Reverse proxy using [Nginx Proxy Manager](https://nginxproxymanager.com/) with [CloudFlare](https://www.cloudflare.com/).
- HomeLab services running as HA add-on.

## 🚀 Motivation

I write this documentation for two main reasons:

1. **To keep track of growing my smart home.** To maintain an understanding of how things are working.
2. **To help other enthusiasts inspire.** People often ask about my smart home setup. Now I can give them a link to this documentation, instead of explaining everything once again.

## ⚠️ Limitations

I'm renting my apartment. My landlord handles fixing stuff in my home, covering all the expenses. The only downside is that I can't change anything in my home.

I can't disassemble anything and use custom switches or sockets. It means I can change only easily accessible parts, like bulbs.

## 🔮 Future Plans

I have a [public kanban board][kanban-board] with ideas and tasks for my smart home. You can follow and comment my plans there.
